# Moove-infra

Moove-infra is the infrastructure of the models used on the Moove platform, and consists of model launcher, rag worker and infrastructure controller. 
We use native `vllm serve` as model launcher, use [milvus-io/milvus](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus) as the vector database, 
and use `fastapi` framework to build the rag worker and infrastructure controller.

## How to start it
To start the Moove-infra, you should first set up the environment by running
```sh
./setup.sh
```
Then install and start the `milvus` open-source vector database by [docker or docker compose](https://milvus.io/docs/install_standalone-docker.md).

If you want to use docker compose to install, the config file and commands are already in the `vllm-rag/milvus`.

After starting the milvus, you should start the model launcher by running 
```sh
./model_launch.sh
```
in the `vllm-serve` folder.

Then start the rag worker and infrastructure controller by running
```sh
./rag_worker_launch.sh
```
in the `vllm-rag` folder and 
```sh
./app_launch.sh
```
in the `vllm-serve` folder.

## How to use it
Currently Moove-infra supports direct operations on vector databases and LLM answers generation with RAG enhancements. For more specific usage methods, please see the following specific test cases.

- `test/add_group.sh`: create one group/organization in the vector database if it doesn't exist.
- `test/delete_group.sh`: delete one group/organization in the vector databse if it exists.
- `test/add_document.sh`: add the chunks of one specific document into one specific group/organization in the vector database if this group/organization exists.
- `test/add_document.sh`: delete all chunks of one specific document in one specific group/organization in the vector database if this document actually in the group/organization.
- `test/get_information.sh`: get information about all groups/organizations in one dictionary.
- `test/search.sh`: get the targeted chunks directly which will be added into the user prompt.
- `test/llm_call_without_rag.sh`: get the llm answer without RAG enhancementã€‚
- `test/llm_call_with_rag.sh`: get the llm answer with RAG enhancement.
